How do we Sort Lists? Reasoning about List Sorting Algorithms
=============================================================


Let see how we can use the abstract refinements to verify that
the result of a list sorting function is actually a sorted list.

\begin{code}
module ListSort (insertSort, insertSort', mergeSort, quickSort) where
\end{code}

First, lets describe a sorted list:

\begin{code}The list type is refined with an abstract refinement, yielding the refined type:
data [a] <p :: a -> a -> Bool> where
  | []  :: [a] <p>
  | (:) :: h:a -> [a<p h>]<p> -> [a]<p>
\end{code}

The definition states that a value of type `[a]<p>` is either empty (`[]`)
or constructed from a pair of a head `h::a` and a tail of a list of a values 
each of which satisfies the refinement (`p h`). 
Furthermore, the abstract refinement `p` holds recursively within the
tail, ensuring that the relationship `p` holds between all pairs of list elements.


\begin{code}A sorted list is defined by instantiating the abstract refinement `p` with 
\fld v -> v >= fld
\end{code}

So, we define the type-synonym `SList a`

\begin{code}
{-@ type SList a = [a]<{v: a | (v >= fld)}> @-}
\end{code}



We aim to verify that the result of each sorting function is of type `SList a`

Insert Sort
-----------

Lets write a function `insert` that inserts an element into the correct position of a sorted list:

\begin{code}
insert y []                   = [y]
insert y (x : xs) | y <= x    = y : x : xs 
                  | otherwise = x : insert y xs
\end{code}

Its type states that if you give `insert` an element and a sorted list,
it returns a sorted list.
 
To write `insertSort`, 
we can recursively apply this `insert` to the elements of the list:

\begin{code}
{-@ insertSort :: (Ord a) => xs:[a] -> SList a @-}
insertSort            :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
insertSort []         = []
insertSort (x:xs)     = insert x (insertSort xs) 
\end{code}

And the system can prove that the result of `insertSort` is a sorted list.

(TODO : foldr)

\begin{code}
{-@ insertSort' :: (Ord a) => xs:[a] -> SList a @-}
insertSort' xs        = foldr insert [] xs
\end{code}

Merge Sort
----------

We first write a `merge` function:

\begin{code}
merge :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
merge xs [] = xs
merge [] ys = ys
merge (x:xs) (y:ys)
  | x <= y
  = x:(merge xs (y:ys))
  | otherwise 
  = y:(merge (x:xs) ys)
\end{code}

The system can prove that if both arguments of `merge` are sorted lists, 
then its result is also a sorted list.

Next, we write a `split` function that splits any list in two sublists:
\begin{code}
split :: [a] -> ([a], [a])
split (x:(y:zs)) = (x:xs, y:ys) where (xs, ys) = split zs
split xs         = (xs, [])
\end{code}

Finally, using the above functions we write `mergeSort`:

\begin{code}
{-@ mergeSort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> SList a @-}
mergeSort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
mergeSort []  = []
mergeSort [x] = [x]
mergeSort xs  = merge (mergeSort xs1) (mergeSort xs2) where (xs1, xs2) = split xs
\end{code}

The system can prove that the result of `mergeSort` is a sorted list.
For the first two cases empty lists or lists with one element can easily proved
to be sorted. For the last case, if we assume that `mergeSort`'s result is a 
sorted list, then `merge` is applied to two sorted lists, thus its result will
be also a sorted list.

Quick Sort
----------

\begin{code}We would like to define `quickSort` as follows:
quickSort' []     = []
quickSort' (x:xs) = append' lts gts 
  where lts = quickSort' [y | y <- xs, y < x]
        gts = quickSort' [z | z <- xs, z >= x]

append []     ys  = k : ys
append (x:xs) ys  = x : append k xs ys
\end{code}


In order for `quicksort` to return a sorted list,
append should return a sorted list.
Thus, we would like to be able to express the fact that `append`
is called with two sorted lists and each element of the first list 
is less than each element of the second.
To do so, we provide `append` one more argument or a ``ghost'' variable, say `k`, of type `a`
and give it the type

\begin{code}
{-@ append :: forall a. k:a -> SList {v:a | v<k} -> SList {v:a | v>=k} -> SList a @-}
\end{code}

So, `append` is defined as:

\begin{code}
append k []     ys  = k : ys
append k (x:xs) ys  = x : append k xs ys
\end{code}

And finally we can define `quicksort`:

\begin{code}
{-@ quickSort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> SList a @-}
quickSort []     = []
quickSort (x:xs) = append x lts gts 
  where lts = quickSort [y | y <- xs, y < x]
        gts = quickSort [z | z <- xs, z >= x]
\end{code}
