-- Note [Two-pass merging algorithm]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- We use a two-pass implementation of merging algorithm. One pass,
-- implemented by merge, performs merging in a top-down manner. Second
-- one, implemented by makeT, ensures that rank invariant of weight
-- biased leftist tree is not violated after merging.
--
-- Notation:
--
--  h1, h2 - heaps being merged
--  p1, p2 - priority of root element in h1 and h2
--  l1     - left  subtree in the first  heap
--  r1     - right subtree in the first  heap
--  l2     - left  subtree in the second heap
--  r2     - right subtree in the second heap
--
-- Merge function analyzes four cases. Two of them are base cases:
--
--    a) h1 is empty - return h2
--
--    b) h2 is empty - return h1
--
-- The other two cases form the inductive definition of merge:
--
--    c) priority p1 is higher than p2 - p1 becomes new root, l1
--       becomes its one child and result of merging r1 with h2
--       becomes the other child:
--
--               p1
--              /  \
--             /    \
--            l1  r1+h2 -- here "+" denotes merging
--
--    d) priority p2 is higher than p2 - p2 becomes new root, l2
--       becomes its one child and result of merging r2 with h1
--       becomes the other child.
--
--               p2
--              /  \
--             /    \
--            l2  r2+h1
--
-- Note that there is no guarantee that rank of r1+h2 (or r2+h1) will
-- be smaller than rank of l1 (or l2). To ensure that merged heap
-- maintains the rank invariant we pass both childred - ie. either l1
-- and r1+h2 or l2 and r2+h1 - to makeT, which creates a new node by
-- inspecting sizes of children and swapping them if necessary.

-- makeT takes an element (Priority) and two heaps (trees). It
-- constructs a new heap with element at the root and two heaps as
-- children. makeT ensures that WBL heap rank invariant is maintained
-- in the newly created tree by reversing left and right subtrees when
-- necessary (note the inversed r and l in the False alternative of
-- case expression).
{-@ makeT   :: p:a -> h1:PHeap {v:a | p <= v} -> h2:PHeap {v:a | p <= v}

makeT p l r = case rank l >= rank r of
                True  ->  Node p (1 + rank l + rank r) l r
                False ->  Node p (1 + rank l + rank r) r l

-- merge combines two heaps into one. There are two base cases and two
-- recursive cases - see [Two-pass Merging algorithm]. Recursive cases
-- call makeT to ensure that rank invariant is maintained after
-- merging.

-- deleteMin removes the element with the highest priority by merging
-- subtrees of a root element. Again the case of empty heap is
-- problematic. We could give it semantics by returning Empty, but
-- this just doesn't feel right. Why should we be able to remove
-- elements from an empty heap?

-- heap constructed by inserting following priorities into an empty
-- heap: 3, 0, 1, 2.
