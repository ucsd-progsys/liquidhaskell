-- Catching exceptions

-- |This is the simplest of the exception-catching functions.  It
-- takes a single argument, runs it, and if an exception is raised
-- the \"handler\" is executed, with the value of the exception passed as an
-- argument.  Otherwise, the result is returned as normal.  For example:
--
-- >   catch (openFile f ReadMode) 
-- >       (\e -> hPutStr stderr ("Couldn't open "++f++": " ++ show e))
--
-- For catching exceptions in pure (non-'IO') expressions, see the
-- function 'evaluate'.
--
-- Note that due to Haskell\'s unspecified evaluation order, an
-- expression may return one of several possible exceptions: consider
-- the expression @error \"urk\" + 1 \`div\` 0@.  Does
-- 'catch' execute the handler passing
-- @ErrorCall \"urk\"@, or @ArithError DivideByZero@?
--
-- The answer is \"either\": 'catch' makes a
-- non-deterministic choice about which exception to catch.  If you
-- call it again, you might get a different exception back.  This is
-- ok, because 'catch' is an 'IO' computation.
--
-- Note that 'catch' catches all types of exceptions, and is generally
-- used for \"cleaning up\" before passing on the exception using
-- 'throwIO'.  It is not good practice to discard the exception and
-- continue, without first checking the type of the exception (it
-- might be a 'ThreadKilled', for example).  In this case it is usually better
-- to use 'catchJust' and select the kinds of exceptions to catch.
--
-- Also note that the "Prelude" also exports a function called
-- 'Prelude.catch' with a similar type to 'Control.OldException.catch',
-- except that the "Prelude" version only catches the IO and user
-- families of exceptions (as required by Haskell 98).  
--
-- We recommend either hiding the "Prelude" version of 'Prelude.catch'
-- when importing "Control.OldException": 
--
-- > import Prelude hiding (catch)
--
-- or importing "Control.OldException" qualified, to avoid name-clashes:
--
-- > import qualified Control.OldException as C
--
-- and then using @C.catch@
--

catch   :: IO a                 -- ^ The computation to run
        -> (Exception -> IO a)  -- ^ Handler to invoke if an exception is raised
        -> IO a
-- note: bundling the exceptions is done in the New.Exception
-- instance of Exception; see below.
catch = New.catch

-- | The function 'catchJust' is like 'catch', but it takes an extra
-- argument which is an /exception predicate/, a function which
-- selects which type of exceptions we\'re interested in.  There are
-- some predefined exception predicates for useful subsets of
-- exceptions: 'ioErrors', 'arithExceptions', and so on.  For example,
-- to catch just calls to the 'error' function, we could use
--
-- >   result <- catchJust errorCalls thing_to_try handler
--
-- Any other exceptions which are not matched by the predicate
-- are re-raised, and may be caught by an enclosing
-- 'catch' or 'catchJust'.
catchJust
        :: (Exception -> Maybe b) -- ^ Predicate to select exceptions
        -> IO a                   -- ^ Computation to run
        -> (b -> IO a)            -- ^ Handler
        -> IO a
catchJust p a handler = catch a handler'
  where handler' e = case p e of 
                        Nothing -> throw e
                        Just b  -> handler b

-- | A version of 'catch' with the arguments swapped around; useful in
-- situations where the code for the handler is shorter.  For example:
--
-- >   do handle (\e -> exitWith (ExitFailure 1)) $
-- >      ...
handle     :: (Exception -> IO a) -> IO a -> IO a
handle     =  flip catch

-- | A version of 'catchJust' with the arguments swapped around (see
-- 'handle').
handleJust :: (Exception -> Maybe b) -> (b -> IO a) -> IO a -> IO a
handleJust p =  flip (catchJust p)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 'mapException'

-- | This function maps one exception into another as proposed in the
-- paper \"A semantics for imprecise exceptions\".

-- Notice that the usage of 'unsafePerformIO' is safe here.

mapException :: (Exception -> Exception) -> a -> a
mapException f v = unsafePerformIO (catch (evaluate v)
                                          (\x -> throw (f x)))

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 'try' and variations.

-- | Similar to 'catch', but returns an 'Either' result which is
-- @('Right' a)@ if no exception was raised, or @('Left' e)@ if an
-- exception was raised and its value is @e@.
--
-- >  try a = catch (Right `liftM` a) (return . Left)
--
-- Note: as with 'catch', it is only polite to use this variant if you intend
-- to re-throw the exception after performing whatever cleanup is needed.
-- Otherwise, 'tryJust' is generally considered to be better.
--
-- Also note that "System.IO.Error" also exports a function called
-- 'System.IO.Error.try' with a similar type to 'Control.OldException.try',
-- except that it catches only the IO and user families of exceptions
-- (as required by the Haskell 98 @IO@ module).

try :: IO a -> IO (Either Exception a)
try a = catch (a >>= \ v -> return (Right v)) (\e -> return (Left e))

-- | A variant of 'try' that takes an exception predicate to select
-- which exceptions are caught (c.f. 'catchJust').  If the exception
-- does not match the predicate, it is re-thrown.
tryJust :: (Exception -> Maybe b) -> IO a -> IO (Either b a)
tryJust p a = do

-- Some Useful Functions

-- | When you want to acquire a resource, do some work with it, and
-- then release the resource, it is a good idea to use 'bracket',
-- because 'bracket' will install the necessary exception handler to
-- release the resource in the event that an exception is raised
-- during the computation.  If an exception is raised, then 'bracket' will 
-- re-raise the exception (after performing the release).
--
-- A common example is opening a file:
--
-- > bracket
-- >   (openFile "filename" ReadMode)
-- >   (hClose)
-- >   (\handle -> do { ... })
--
-- The arguments to 'bracket' are in this order so that we can partially apply 
-- it, e.g.:
--
-- > withFile name mode = bracket (openFile name mode) hClose

-- Asynchronous exceptions

{- $async

 #AsynchronousExceptions# Asynchronous exceptions are so-called because they arise due to
external influences, and can be raised at any point during execution.
'StackOverflow' and 'HeapOverflow' are two examples of
system-generated asynchronous exceptions.

The primary source of asynchronous exceptions, however, is
'throwTo':

>  throwTo :: ThreadId -> Exception -> IO ()

'throwTo' (also 'throwDynTo' and 'Control.Concurrent.killThread') allows one
running thread to raise an arbitrary exception in another thread.  The
exception is therefore asynchronous with respect to the target thread,
which could be doing anything at the time it receives the exception.
Great care should be taken with asynchronous exceptions; it is all too
easy to introduce race conditions by the over zealous use of
'throwTo'.
-}

{- $block_handler
There\'s an implied 'mask_' around every exception handler in a call
to one of the 'catch' family of functions.  This is because that is
what you want most of the time - it eliminates a common race condition
in starting an exception handler, because there may be no exception
handler on the stack to handle another exception if one arrives
immediately.  If asynchronous exceptions are blocked on entering the
handler, though, we have time to install a new exception handler
before being interrupted.  If this weren\'t the default, one would have
to write something like

>      mask $ \restore ->
>           catch (restore (...))
>                      (\e -> handler)

If you need to unblock asynchronous exceptions again in the exception
handler, just use 'unblock' as normal.

Note that 'try' and friends /do not/ have a similar default, because
there is no exception handler in this case.  If you want to use 'try'
in an asynchronous-exception-safe way, you will need to use
'mask'.
-}

{- $interruptible

Some operations are /interruptible/, which means that they can receive
asynchronous exceptions even in the scope of a 'mask'.  Any function
which may itself block is defined as interruptible; this includes
'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar'
(but not 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.tryTakeMVar'),
and most operations which perform
some I\/O with the outside world.  The reason for having
interruptible operations is so that we can write things like

>      mask $ \restore -> do
>         a <- takeMVar m
>         catch (restore (...))
>               (\e -> ...)

if the 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar' was not interruptible,
then this particular
combination could lead to deadlock, because the thread itself would be
blocked in a state where it can\'t receive any asynchronous exceptions.
With 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar' interruptible, however, we can be
safe in the knowledge that the thread can receive exceptions right up
until the point when the 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar' succeeds.
Similar arguments apply for other interruptible operations like
'System.IO.openFile'.

        -- because there are no other references to this 'MVar'.
  | BlockedIndefinitely
        -- ^The current thread was waiting to retry an atomic memory transaction
        -- that could never become possible to complete because there are no other
        -- threads referring to any of the TVars involved.
  | NestedAtomically
        -- ^The runtime detected an attempt to nest one STM transaction
        -- inside another one, presumably due to the use of 
        -- 'unsafePeformIO' with 'atomically'.
  | Deadlock
        -- ^There are no runnable threads, so the program is
        -- deadlocked.  The 'Deadlock' exception is
        -- raised in the main thread only (see also: "Control.Concurrent").
  | DynException        Dynamic
        -- ^Dynamically typed exceptions (see section on Dynamic Exceptions: "Control.OldException\#DynamicExceptions").
  | ErrorCall           String
        -- ^The 'ErrorCall' exception is thrown by 'error'.  The 'String'
        -- argument of 'ErrorCall' is the string passed to 'error' when it was
        -- called.
  | ExitException       New.ExitCode
        -- ^The 'ExitException' exception is thrown by 'System.Exit.exitWith' (and
        -- 'System.Exit.exitFailure').  The 'ExitCode' argument is the value passed 
        -- to 'System.Exit.exitWith'.  An unhandled 'ExitException' exception in the
        -- main thread will cause the program to be terminated with the given 
        -- exit code.
  | IOException         New.IOException
        -- ^These are the standard IO exceptions generated by
        -- Haskell\'s @IO@ operations.  See also "System.IO.Error".
  | NoMethodError       String
        -- ^An attempt was made to invoke a class method which has
        -- no definition in this instance, and there was no default
        -- definition given in the class declaration.  GHC issues a
        -- warning when you compile an instance which has missing
        -- methods.
  | NonTermination
        -- ^The current thread is stuck in an infinite loop.  This
        -- exception may or may not be thrown when the program is
        -- non-terminating.
  | PatternMatchFail    String
        -- ^A pattern matching failure.  The 'String' argument should contain a
        -- descriptive message including the function name, source file
        -- and line number.
  | RecConError         String
        -- ^An attempt was made to evaluate a field of a record
        -- for which no value was given at construction time.  The
        -- 'String' argument gives the location of the
        -- record construction in the source program.
  | RecSelError         String
        -- ^A field selection was attempted on a constructor that
        -- doesn\'t have the requested field.  This can happen with
        -- multi-constructor records when one or more fields are
        -- missing from some of the constructors.  The
        -- 'String' argument gives the location of the
        -- record selection in the source program.
  | RecUpdError         String
        -- ^An attempt was made to update a field in a record,
        -- where the record doesn\'t have the requested field.  This can
        -- only occur with multi-constructor records, when one or more
        -- fields are missing from some of the constructors.  The
        -- 'String' argument gives the location of the
        -- record update in the source program.
