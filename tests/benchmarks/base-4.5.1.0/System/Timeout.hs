-- |Wrap an 'IO' computation to time out and return @Nothing@ in case no result
-- is available within @n@ microseconds (@1\/10^6@ seconds). In case a result
-- is available before the timeout expires, @Just a@ is returned. A negative
-- timeout interval means \"wait indefinitely\". When specifying long timeouts,
-- be careful not to exceed @maxBound :: Int@.
--
-- The design of this combinator was guided by the objective that @timeout n f@
-- should behave exactly the same as @f@ as long as @f@ doesn't time out. This
-- means that @f@ has the same 'myThreadId' it would have without the timeout
-- wrapper. Any exceptions @f@ might throw cancel the timeout and propagate
-- further up. It also possible for @f@ to receive exceptions thrown to it by
-- another thread.
--
-- A tricky implementation detail is the question of how to abort an @IO@
-- computation. This combinator relies on asynchronous exceptions internally.
-- The technique works very well for computations executing inside of the
-- Haskell runtime system, but it doesn't work at all for non-Haskell code.
-- Foreign function calls, for example, cannot be timed out with this
-- combinator simply because an arbitrary C function cannot receive
-- asynchronous exceptions. When @timeout@ is used to wrap an FFI call that
-- blocks, no timeout event can be delivered until the FFI call returns, which
-- pretty much negates the purpose of the combinator. In practice, however,
-- this limitation is less severe than it may sound. Standard I\/O functions
-- like 'System.IO.hGetBuf', 'System.IO.hPutBuf', Network.Socket.accept, or
-- 'System.IO.hWaitForInput' appear to be blocking, but they really don't
-- because the runtime system uses scheduling mechanisms like @select(2)@ to
-- perform asynchronous I\/O, so it is possible to interrupt standard socket
-- I\/O or file I\/O using this combinator.
