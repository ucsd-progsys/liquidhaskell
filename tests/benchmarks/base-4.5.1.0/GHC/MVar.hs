{- ^
An 'MVar' (pronounced \"em-var\") is a synchronising variable, used
for communication between concurrent threads.  It can be thought of
as a a box, which may be empty or full.
-}

-- pull in Eq (Mvar a) too, to avoid GHC.Conc being an orphan-instance module
instance Eq (MVar a) where
        (MVar mvar1#) == (MVar mvar2#) = sameMVar# mvar1# mvar2#

{-
M-Vars are rendezvous points for concurrent threads.  They begin
empty, and any attempt to read an empty M-Var blocks.  When an M-Var
is written, a single blocked thread may be freed.  Reading an M-Var
toggles its state from full back to empty.  Therefore, any value
written to an M-Var may only be read once.  Multiple reads and writes
are allowed, but there must be at least one read between any two
writes.

-- There are two further important properties of 'takeMVar':
--
--   * 'takeMVar' is single-wakeup.  That is, if there are multiple
--     threads blocked in 'takeMVar', and the 'MVar' becomes full,
--     only one thread will be woken up.  The runtime guarantees that
--     the woken thread completes its 'takeMVar' operation.
--
--   * When multiple threads are blocked on an 'MVar', they are
--     woken up in FIFO order.  This is useful for providing
--     fairness properties of abstractions built using 'MVar's.
