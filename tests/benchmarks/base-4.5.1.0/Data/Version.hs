-- A general library for representation and manipulation of versions.
-- 
-- Versioning schemes are many and varied, so the version
-- representation provided by this library is intended to be a
-- compromise between complete generality, where almost no common
-- functionality could reasonably be provided, and fixing a particular
-- versioning scheme, which would probably be too restrictive.
-- 
-- So the approach taken here is to provide a representation which
-- subsumes many of the versioning schemes commonly in use, and we
-- provide implementations of 'Eq', 'Ord' and conversion to\/from 'String'
-- which will be appropriate for some applications, but not all.

A 'Version' represents the version of a software entity.  

An instance of 'Eq' is provided, which implements exact equality
modulo reordering of the tags in the 'versionTags' field.

An instance of 'Ord' is also provided, which gives lexicographic
ordering on the 'versionBranch' fields (i.e. 2.1 > 2.0, 1.2.3 > 1.2.2,
etc.).  This is expected to be sufficient for many uses, but note that
you may need to use a more specific ordering for your versioning
scheme.  For example, some versioning schemes may include pre-releases
which have tags @\"pre1\"@, @\"pre2\"@, and so on, and these would need to
be taken into account when determining ordering.  In some cases, date
ordering may be more appropriate, so the application would have to
look for @date@ tags in the 'versionTags' field and compare those.
The bottom line is, don't always assume that 'compare' and other 'Ord'
operations are the right thing for every 'Version'.

Similarly, concrete representations of versions may differ.  One
possible concrete representation is provided (see 'showVersion' and
'parseVersion'), but depending on the application a different concrete
representation may be more appropriate.

                -- points (1,2,3...), and the first branch off the trunk after

                -- version 3 is 3.2, and so on.  The tree can be branched
