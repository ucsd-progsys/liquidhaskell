-- Class of data structures that can be folded to a summary value.
--
-- Many of these functions generalize "Prelude", "Control.Monad" and
-- "Data.List" functions of the same names from lists to any 'Foldable'
-- functor.  To avoid ambiguity, either import those modules hiding
-- these names or qualify uses of these function names with an alias
-- for this module.

-- | Data structures that can be folded.
--
-- Minimal complete definition: 'foldMap' or 'foldr'.
--
-- For example, given a data type
--
-- > data Tree a = Empty | Leaf a | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)
--
-- a suitable instance would be
--
-- > instance Foldable Tree where
-- >    foldMap f Empty = mempty
-- >    foldMap f (Leaf x) = f x
-- >    foldMap f (Node l k r) = foldMap f l `mappend` f k `mappend` foldMap f r
--
-- This is suitable even for abstract types, as the monoid is assumed
-- to satisfy the monoid laws.  Alternatively, one could define @foldr@:
--
-- > instance Foldable Tree where
-- >    foldr f z Empty = z
-- >    foldr f z (Leaf x) = f x z
-- >    foldr f z (Node l k r) = foldr f (f k (foldr f z r)) l
