# General Development Guide

For those diving into the implementation of LiquidHaskell, here are a few tips:

## Fast (re)compilation

When working on the `liquidhaskell` library, usually all we want is to make changes and quickly recompile
only the bare minimum, to try out new ideas. Using a fully-fledged GHC plugin doesn't help in this sense,
because packages like `liquid-base` or `liquid-ghc-prim` all have a direct dependency on `liquidhaskell`, and
therefore every time the latter changes, an expensive rebuild of those packages is triggered, which
might become tedious overtime. To mitigate this, we offer a faster, "dev-style" build mode which is based
on the assumption that most changes to the `liquidhaskell` library do not alter the validity of
already-checked libraries, and therefore things like `liquid-base` and `liquid-ghc-prim` can be considered
"static assets", avoiding the need for a recompilation. In other terms, we explicitly disable recompilation
of any of the `liquid-*` ancillary library in dev mode, so that rebuilds would also influence the 
`liquidhaskell` library.

### Usage and recommended workflow

This is how you can use this:

* To begin with, perform a **full** build of **all** the libraries, by doing either `cabal v2-build` or `stack build`,
  **without** specifying any extra environment variables from the command line. This is needed to ensure that
  we things like `liquid-base` and `liquid-ghc-prim` are compiled at least once, as we would need the
  refinements they contain to correctly checks other downstream programs;

* At this point, the content of the `liquid-*` packages is considered "trusted" and "frozen", until you won't
  force another full, _non-dev_ build;

* In order to quickly test changes to the `liquidhaskell` library without recompiling the `liquid-*` packages,
  we need to start a build passing the `LIQUID_DEV_MODE` env var as part of the build command. Examples:

#### Stack

```
LIQUID_DEV_MODE=true stack build
```

If on NixOS

```
LIQUID_DEV_MODE=true stack --no-nix-pure build
```

With the above, `stack` will unregister and re-register the libraries,
but hopefully it won't rebuild any modules.

#### Cabal

```
LIQUID_DEV_MODE=true cabal v2-build
```

It's also possible (but not recommended) to add `LIQUID_DEV_MODE` to .bashrc or similar, but this would
permanently disable building the `liquid-*` packages, and this might silently mask breaking changes to the
`liquidhaskell` library that would manifest only when compiling these other packages.

If you wish to force building all the libraries again, it's sufficient to issue the same builds commands 
without the `LIQUID_DEV_MODE`.

## How To Run Regression Tests

For documentation on the `test-driver` executable itself, please refer to the
`README.md` in `tests/` or run `cabal run tests:test-driver -- --help` or `stack
run test-driver -- --help`

You can run *all* the tests by

    $ ./scripts/test/test_plugin.sh

You can run a bunch of particular test-groups instead by

    $ LIQUID_DEV_MODE=true ./scripts/test/test_plugin.sh <test-group-name1> <test-group-name2> ...

and you can list all the possible test options with 

    $ LIQUID_DEV_MODE=true ./scripts/test/test_plugin.sh --help

or get a list of just the test groups, one per line, with

    $ LIQUID_DEV_MODE=true ./scripts/test/test_plugin.sh --show-all

To pass in specific parameters and run a subset of the tests, you can invoke cabal directly with

    $ LIQUID_DEV_MODE=true cabal build tests:<test-group-name> --ghc-options=-fplugin-opt=LiquidHaskell:--no-termination MySpecificTest

For example:

    $ LIQUID_DEV_MODE=true cabal build tests:unit-neg --ghc-options=--fplugin-opt=LiquidHaskell:--no-termination AbsApp

Or your favorite number of threads, depending on cores etc.

You can directly extend and run the tests by modifying the files in

    tests/harness/

### Parallelism in Tests

Tests run in parallel, unless the flag `--measure-timings` is specified to `test_plugin.sh`.

## How to create performance comparison charts

When `liquidhaskell` tests run, we can collect timing information with

    $ ./scripts/test/test_plugin.sh --measure-timings

Measures will be collected in `.dump-timings` files. These can be converted to json
data with

```bash
cabal v2-build ghc-timings
cabal v2-exec ghc-timings dist-newstyle
```

which will produce `tmp/*.json` files.

Then a csv report can be generated from this json files with
```
cabal v2-run benchmark-timings -- tmp/*.json --phase LiquidHaskell -o summary.csv
```
On each line, the report will contain the time taken by each test.

There is a script `scripts/plot-performance/chart_perf.sh` that can be
used to generate comparison charts in `svg` and `png` formats. It
requires [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) to run. The following
command will produce two files `perf.svg` and `perf.png` in the
current directory.

    $ scripts/plot-performance/chart_perf.sh path_to_before_summary.csv path_to_after_summary.csv

The current formatting is optimized for comparing the outputs of running
the benchmarks alone.

    $ scripts/test/test_plugin.sh \
        benchmark-stitch-lh \
        benchmark-bytestring \
        benchmark-vector-algorithms \
        benchmark-cse230 \
        benchmark-esop2013 \
        benchmark-icfp15-pos \
        benchmark-icfp15-neg

## Releasing on Hackage

*NOTE: The following section is relevant only for few developers, i.e. the ones which are directly involved
in the release process. Most contributors can skip this section.*

We provide a convenience script to upload all the `liquid-*` packages (**including** `liquid-fixpoint`) on
Hackage, in a lockstep fashion. To do so, it's possible to simply run the `scripts/release_to_hackage.sh`
Bash script. The script doesn't accept any argument and it tries to determine the packages
to upload by scanning the `$PWD` for packages named appropriately. It will ask the user for confirmation
before proceeding, and `stack upload` will be used under the hood.

## GHC support policy

LH supports only one version of GHC at any given time. This is because LH depends heavily on the `ghc` library
and there is currently no distinction between public API's and API's internal to GHC. There are currently no
release notes for the `ghc` library and breaking changes happen without notice and without deprecation
periods. Supporting only one GHC version saves developer time because it obviates the need for `#ifdef`'s
throughout the codebase, or for an compatibility layer that becomes increasingly difficult to write as we
attempt to support more GHC versions. Porting to newer GHC versions takes less time, the code is easier to
read and there is less code duplication.

Users of older versions of GHC can still use older versions of LH.

## The GHC.API module

In order to minimize the effort in porting LH to new releases of GHC, we need a way to abstract over breaking
changes in the `ghc` library, which might change substantially with every major GHC release. This is
accomplished by the [GHC.API][] module. The idea is that **rather than importing multiple `ghc` modules,
LH developers must import this single module in order to write future-proof code**. This is especially
important for versions of the compiler greater than 9, where the module hierarchy changed substantially,
and using the [GHC.API][] makes it easier to support new versions of GHC when they are released.

### Fragile import strategy

```haskell
import Predicate
import TyCoRep

...

-- This will break if 'isEqPrimPred' is (re)moved or the import hierarchy changes.
foo :: Type -> Bool
foo = isEqPrimPred
```

### Recommended import strategy

```haskell
import qualified Language.Haskell.Liquid.GHC.API as GHC

...

foo :: GHC.Type -> Bool
foo = GHC.isEqPrimPred -- OK.
```

# GHC Plugin Development Guide

This code commentary describes the current architecture for the GHC [Plugin][] that enables LiquidHaskell
to check files as part of the normal compilation process. For the sake of this commentary, we refer to
the code provided as part of the `release/0.8.10.2` branch, commit `9a2f8284c5fe5b18ed0410e842acd3329a629a6b`.

## GHC.Interface vs GHC.Plugin

The module [GHC.Plugin][] is the main entrypoint for all the plugin functionalities. Whenever possible, this
module is reusing common functionalities from the [GHC.Interface][], which is the original module used to
interface LH with the old executable. Generally speaking, the [GHC.Interface][] module is considered "legacy"
and it's rarely what one wants to modify. It will probably be removed at some point.

## The GhcMonadLike shim

Part of the tension in designing the plugin was trying to reuse as much code as possible from the original
[GHC.Interface][] shipped with LiquidHaskell. Unfortunately this was not possible from the get-go due to the
fact most of the functions provided by that module were requiring a [GhcMonad][] constraint or usually
living in the [Ghc monad][], which is also the only concrete type which derives an instance for [GhcMonad][].
While we could have run each and every function with `runGhc`, this was not very satisfactory due to the
fact running the `Ghc` monad is fairly expensive as it requires a bit of extra state in order to run it.

However, most of the functions used by the [Ghc.Interface][] didn't require anything specific from the
underlying [Ghc monad][] if not access to the [HscEnv][] and the ability to grab the [DynFlags][], as well
as doing `IO`. Therefore, the [GhcMonadLike][] shim was born with the intent of replicating some of the
functions used by the [GHC.Interface][] but crucially making those polymorphic in a generic [GhcMonadLike][]
for which we can give instances for `CoreM`, `TcM` etc. We can do this because we do not require the extra
`ExceptionMonad` constraint and we do not require to implement `setHscEnv`.

This allowed us to change ever so slightly the functions provided by the [GHC.Interface][], expose them and
reuse them in the [Plugin][] module.

## Plugin architecture

Broadly speaking, the Plugin is organised this way: In the [typechecking phase][], we typecheck and desugar
each module via the GHC API in order to extract the unoptimised [core binds][] that are needed by
LH to work correctly. This is due to a tension in the design space; from one side LH needs access to the
"raw" core binds (binds where primitives types are not unboxed in the presence of a PRAGMA annotation,
for example) but yet the user can specify any arbitrary optimisation settings during compilation and we do
not want to betray the principle of least expectation by silently compiling the code with `-O0`. Practically
speaking, this introduces some overhead and is far from ideal, but for now it allows us to iterate quickly.
This phase is also responsible for:

* Extracting the [BareSpec][]s associated to any of the dependent modules;
* Producing the [LiftedSpec][] for the currently-compiled module;
* Storing the [LiftedSpec][] into an interface annotation for later retrieval;
* Checking and verifying the module using LH's existing API.

The reason why we do everything in the [typechecking phase][] is also to allow integrations with tools like
[ghcide][]. There are a number of differences between the plugin and the operations performed as part of the
[GHC.Interface][], which we are going to outline in the next section.

## Differences with the GHC.Interface

- The [GHC.Interface][] pre-processes the input files and calls into [configureGhcTargets][] trying to
  build a dependency graph by discovering dependencies the target files might require. Then, from this
  list any file in the include directory is filtered out, as well as any module which has
  a "fresh" `.bspec` file on disk, to save time during checking. In the [GHC.Plugin][] module though
  we don't do this and for us, essentially, each input file is considered a target, where we exploit the
  fact GHC will skip recompilation if unnecessary. This also implies that while the [GHC.Interface][] calls
  into [processTargetModule][] only for target files, the [GHC.Plugin][] has a single, flat function simply
  called [processModule][] that essentially does the same as `GHC.Interface.processModule` and
  `GHC.Interface.processTargetModule` fused together.

- While the [GHC.Interface][] sometimes "assembles" a [BareSpec][] by `mappend`ing the `commSpec` (i.e. comment spec)
  with the [LiftedSpec][] fetched from disk, if any, the Plugin doesn't do this but rather piggybacks on the
  [SpecFinder][] (described later) to fetch dependencies' specs.

- There is a difference in how we process LIQUID pragmas. In particular, for the executable they seems to
  be accumulated "in bulk" i.e. if we are refining a *target* module `A` that depends on `B`, `B` seems to
  inherit whichever flags we were using in the *target* module `A`. Conversely, the source plugin is "stateless"
  when it comes to LIQUID options, i.e. it doesn't have memory of _past_ options, what it counts when compiling
  a module `B` is the _global_ options and _any_ option this module defines. The analogy is exactly the
  same as with GHC language extensions, they have either global scope (i.e. `default-extensions` in the
  cabal manifest) or local scope (i.e. `{-# LANGUAGE ... #-}`).

## Finding specs for existing modules

This is all done by a specialised module called the [SpecFinder][]. The main exported function is
[findRelevantSpecs][] which, given a list of `Module`s, tries to retrieve the `LiftedSpec`s associated with
them. Typically this is done by looking into the interface files of the input modules, trying to deserialise
any `LiftedSpec` from the interface file's annotations.

# General Development FAQs

## A new version of GHC is out. How do I support it?

Typically the first thing you might want to do is to run a "clean" `cabal v2-build` or `stack build` using
the latest compiler and "check the damage". If you are lucky, everything works out of the box, otherwise
compilation might fail with an error, typically because some `ghc` API function has been removed/moved/renamed.
The way to fix it is to modify the [GHC.API][] shim module and perform any required change, likely by 
conditionally compiling some code in a `CPP` block. For minor changes, it's usually enough to perform small
changes, but for more tricky migrations it might be necessary to backport some GHC code, or create some
patter synonym to deal with changes in type constructors.

## Is there a way to run the testsuite for different versions of GHC?

Currently, no. Only one version of GHC is supported and that is the one
that can be tested with `./scripts/test/test_plugin.sh`.

# GHC Plugin Development FAQs

## Why is the GHC.Interface using slightly different types than the GHC.Plugin module?

Mostly for backward-compatibility and for historical reasons. Types like [BareSpec][] used to be type alias
rather than `newtype`s, and things were slightly renamed to reflect better purpose when the support for the
plugin was added. While doing so we also added a compatibility layer in the form of some `optics` that can be used
to map back and forth (sometimes in a partial way) between old and new data structures. When in doubt,
**consider the GHC.Plugin as the single source of truth, and prefer whichever data structure the latter is
using**.
