# Contribute

We are excited for you to try LH! 

In this section you can find instructions on how to submit your first PR as well as practical instructions
on how develop LiquidHaskell.

## Hacking on LiquidHaskell

If you want to extend LH to fix a bug or provide a new feature, you might be interested in reading
our [Developer's guide](develop.md).

## Reporting a bug

If something doesn't work as it should, please consider opening a [github issue](https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/issues)
to let us know. If possible, try to:

* Try to use a descriptive title;
* State as clearly as possible what is the problem you are facing;
* Provide a small Haskell file producing the issue;
* Write down the expected behaviour vs the actual behaviour;
* If possible, let us know if you have used the [plugin](plugin.md) or the [executable](legacy.md) and
  which _GHC version_ you are using.

## Your first Pull Request

We are thrilled to get PRs! Please follow these guidelines, as doing so will increase the chances of 
having your PR accepted:

* The main LH repo [lives here](https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell)
* Please create pull requests against the `develop` branch.
* Please be sure to include test cases that illustrate the effect of the PR
  - e.g. show new features that that are supported or how it fixes some previous issue
* If the PR adds a `LIQUID` pragma or option, please also add documentation 
  - e.g. in [options.md](options.md) or [specifications.md](specifications.md) 

## Ask for help

If you have further questions or you just need help, you can always reach out to the [community](community.md).
