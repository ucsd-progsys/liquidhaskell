Hopefully, the [previous][ref101] article gave you a basic idea about what
refinement types look like. Several folks had interesting questions, that
are worth discussing in a separate post, since they throw a lot of light 
on the strengths (or weaknesses, depending on your point of view!) of
LiquidHaskell.

How to relate outputs and inputs 
--------------------------------

Recall the function `divide`

\begin{code}
{-@ divide :: Int -> {v: Int | v /= 0 } -> Int @-}
divide     :: Int -> Int -> Int
divide n 0 = error "divide by zero"
divide n d = n `div` d
\end{code}

and `abz` was the absolute value function

\begin{code}
abz               :: Int -> Int
abz n | 0 < n     = n
      | otherwise = 0 - n
\end{code}

[nanothief](http://www.reddit.com/user/nanothief) [remarked][qreddit101]
that LiquidHaskell was unable to verify the safety of the following call to
`divide` (i.e. was unable to show that `x` was non-zero at the callsite).

\begin{code}
{-@ f :: Int -> Int @-}
f x | abz x == 0 = 3
    | otherwise  = 3 `divide` x
\end{code}

Nanothief correctly argues that the code is clearly safe as *"`abz x == 0` being false implies `x /= 0`"*. 
Indeed, the code *is safe*, however, the reason that LiquidHaskell
rejected it has nothing to do with its inability
to  *"track the constraints of values based on tests using new values derived from that value"* as Nanothief surmised,
but instead, because LiquidHaskell supports **modular verification** 
where the *only* thing known about `abz` at a *use site* is 
whatever is specified in its *type*. 

\begin{code}Concretely speaking, the type 
abz :: Int -> {v: Int | 0 <= v }
\end{code}

is too anemic to verify `f` above, as it tells us nothing 
about the *relationship* between the output and input -- looking at it,
we have now way of telling that when the *output* (of `abz`) is 
non-zero, the *input*  must also have been non-zero.

\begin{code}Instead, we can write a *stronger* type which does capture this information, for example
abz :: x:Int -> {v:Int | v = (if (x > 0) then x else (0 - x))}
\end{code}

\begin{code} where 
v = (if p then e1 else e2)
\end{code}

\begin{code} is an abbreviation for the formula 
(p => v == e1) && ((not p) => v = e2)
\end{code}

With this specification for `abz`, LiquidHaskell is able to reason that
when `abz x` is non-zero, `x` is also non-zero. Of course, `abz` is trivial 
enough that we can very precisely capture its *exact* semantics in the 
refinement type, but thats is rarely the case. 

Nevertheless, even here, you could write a somewhat *weaker* specification,
that still had enough juice to allow the verification of the `divide` call
in `f`. In particular, we might write

\begin{code}
{-@ abz :: x:Int -> {v:Int | ((0 <= v) && ((v = 0) <=> (x = 0))) } @-}
\end{code}

which states the output is `0` *if and only if* the input is `0`.
LiquidHaskell will happily verify that `abz` implements this specification,
and will use it to verify the safety of `f` above.

(BTW, follow the link above to *demo this code*  yourself.)

How to tell a Fib
-----------------

[Chris Done](https://twitter.com/christopherdone) [asked][qblog101]
why LiquidHaskell refused to verify the following definition of `fib`.

\begin{code}
{-@ fib :: n:Int -> { b:Int | (n >= 0 && b >= n) } @-}
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
\end{code}

Indeed, the both the *specification* and the *implementation* look pretty
legit, so what gives?  It turns out that there are *two* different reasons why. 

**Reason 1: Assumptions vs. Guarantees**

What we really want to say over here is that the *input* `n` 
is non-negative. However, putting the refinement `n >= 0` in 
the *output* constraint means that it becomes something that 
LiquidHaskell checks that the function `fib` **guarantees** 
(or **ensures**).
That is, the type states that we can pass `fib` *any* value 
`n` (including *negative* values) and yet, `fib` must return 
values `b` such that `b >= n` *and* `n >= 0`. 

The latter requirement is a rather tall order when an arbitrary `n` 
is passed in as input. `fib` can make no such guarantees since 
it was *given* the value `n` as a parameter. The only way `n` could 
be non-negative was that if the caller had sent in a non-negative value. 
Thus, we want to put the *burden of proof* on the right entity here, 
namely the caller.

To assign the burden of proof appropriately, we place the
non-negative refinement on the *input type*

\begin{code}
{-@ fib' :: n:{v:Int | v >= 0} -> {b:Int | (n >= 0 && b >= n) } @-}
fib' :: Int -> Int
fib' 0 = 0
fib' 1 = 1
fib' n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
\end{code}

where now at *calls to* `fib'` LiquidHaskell will check that the argument
is non-negative, and furthermore, when checking `fib'` LiquidHaskell will 
**assume** that the parameter `n` is indeed non-negative. So now the
constraint `n >= 0` on the output is somewhat redundant, and the
non-negative `n` guarantee holds trivially.

**Reason 2: The Specification is a Fib**

If you run the above in the demo, you will see that LiquidHaskell still
does protest loudly, and frankly, one might start getting a little
frustrated at the stubbornness and petulance of the checker.

\begin{code} However, if you stare at the implementation, you will see that it in fact, *does not* meet the specification, as
fib' 2  == fib' 1 + fib' 0
        == 0 + 1
        == 1
\end{code}

LiquidHaskell is reluctant to prove things that are false. Rather than 
anthropomorphize frivolously, lets see why it is unhappy. 

\begin{code}First, recall the somewhat simplified specification 
fib' :: n:Int -> { b:Int | (b >= n) } 
\end{code}

As we saw in the discussion about `abz`, at each recursive callsite
the *only information* LiquidHaskell uses about the returned value, 
is that described in the *output type* for that function call.

\begin{code}Thus, LiquidHaskell reasons that the expression:
fib' (n-1) + fib' (n-2)
\end{code}

\begin{code}has the type
{b: Int | exists b1, b2. b  == b1 + b2 
                      && b1 >= n-1 
                      && b2 >= n-2     }
\end{code}

where the `b1` and `b2` denote the values returned by the 
recursive calls --- we get the above by plugging the parameters
`n-1` and `n-2` in for the parameter `n` in output type for `fib'`.

\begin{code}The SMT solver simplifies the above to
{b: Int | b >= 2n - 3}
\end{code}

\begin{code} Finally, to check the output guarantee is met, LiquidHaskell asks the SMT solver to prove that
(b >= 2n - 3)  =>  (b >= n)
\end{code}

The SMT solver will refuse, of course, since the above implication is 
*not valid* (e.g. when `n` is `2`) Thus, via SMT, LiquidHaskell proclaims
that the function `fib'` does not implement the advertised type and hence
marks it *unsafe*.

Fixing The Code
---------------

How then, do we get Chris' specification to work out? It seems like it 
*should* hold (except for that pesky case where `n=2`. Indeed,
let's rig the code, so that all the base cases return `1`.

\begin{code}
{-@ fibOK :: n:Int -> {b:Int | ((b >= n) && (b >= 1))} @-}
fibOK :: Int -> Int
fibOK 0 = 1
fibOK 1 = 1
fibOK n = fibOK (n-1) + fibOK (n-2)
\end{code}

Here' we specify that not only is the output greater than the input, it is
**also** greater than `1`. 

\begin{code} Now in the recursive case, LiquidHaskell reasons that the value being output is
{b: Int | exists b1, b2. b  == b1 + b2 
                      && b1 >= n-1 && b1 >= 1 
                      && b2 >= n-2 && b2 >= 1 }
\end{code}

\begin{code}which reduces to 
{b: Int | b = 2n - 3 && n >= 2 }
\end{code}

\begin{code}which, the SMT solver is happy to verify, is indeed a subtype
of (i.e. implies the refinement of) the specified output
{b: Int | b >= n && b >= 1 } 
\end{code}

Conclusion
----------

There are several things to take away. 

1. We need to distinguish between *assumptions* and *guarantees* 
   when writing specifications for functions.

2. For *modularity*, LiquidHaskell, like every type system, uses only
   the (refinement) *type*  of each function at each use site, and not the 
   function's *body*.

3. Some seemingly intuitive specifications often aren't; in future work it
   would be useful to actually [generate][mlton]  [tests][concolic] as 
   [counterexamples][icse04] that illustrate when a specification
   [fails][dsd].
